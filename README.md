Interpreting user needs involves understanding what users aim to achieve, their challenges, and how the program can best serve them. 
A crucial tool for this is creating user stories, which capture user needs in simple statements from the user’s perspective, such as “As a customer,
I want to search for flights by date and destination so that I can find the best options for my travel.” 
These stories help break down complex features into manageable tasks, guiding developers in implementing user needs directly into the program. 
When approaching development, I prioritize building iteratively, delivering working versions early to gather feedback. 
Key Agile processes I aim to incorporate include user story mapping, sprint planning, regular reviews, continuous feedback, and retrospectives. 
These processes will ensure development stays user-focused, adaptable, and efficient. 
Being a good team member in software development means open communication, reliability, and collaboration. 
Respecting others’ ideas, sharing updates transparently, adapting to changing requirements, and supporting the team’s success are all essential for positive teamwork.
This Agile mindset fosters both individual and team growth, creating better outcomes for users and the project.
